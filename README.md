Custom Web Components
=====================

Pre-Built, Hand Rolled Components, Ready to Use
Custom Web Components are a set of pre-built hand rolled components, ready to go. From base components for simple tags, through to controls for forms and structure for your pages. this growing library can offer styleable shadowed components to get you going, resources for storage and requests as well as page structure, menuing and routing.

At the heart of this growing library is the need, the want to simplify, make application development a pleasure, rather than the usual chore of build tools, compilations, rebuilds, watching... Simply plug in, and go.

Try the full material based icon sets, build forms using inputs, select boxes, box selectors, radio buttons and switches. Coming with ready to go authentication overlays that can handle full JWT based authentication to API's, follow our other projects to built full AWS lambda stacks through cloud formation. Style your components too through the use of style variables to tweak and manage the look and feel of the components.
